The "MIT" license is a very generic (and wrong) term from a set of
permissive licenses. When most people talk about the "MIT" license, they
actually mean to say the <a href = '/license/expat' >Expat</a> license.
In addition to the <a href = '/license/expat'>Expat</a> license, there's
also the <a href = '/license/xfree-86' >XFree86</a> license or the
<a href = '/license/x11' >MIT/X Consortium</a> license.<br />
<br />
Please do not use the term "MIT" license when defining exactly what terms
something is under.
